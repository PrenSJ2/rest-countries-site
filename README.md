# Rest Countries By Sebastian Prentice

This project is a React application that uses the REST Countries API to display information about different countries.

I have two branches:
- `main` - This branch contains the original project with some extra styling.
- `minimum-requirements` - This branch contains the original project matching the requirements.

## Features

- Search through the countries by name, population, languages, or currencies.
- Select a row for more detailed information about a country.
- Add countries to your favorites list.
- Sort each column by selecting the column title.
